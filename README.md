# Data Engineering Festival
This project is part of data engineering festival at HSBC. 

In this project, you will be using the Spark RDD API for data processing.

## Spark RDD: HackerNews data analysis challenge

You will analyse a dataset of (almost) all submitted HackerNews posts. 

1) First run `python get_data.py` to download the data. Alternatively you can download it from https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kate-datasets/hackernews/HNStories.zip and unzip it.

2) Then you can use the notebook `spark-rdd-homework.ipynb` to prototype your functions
3) Finally write down your functions in `spark_rdd.py` and submit on K.A.T.E.
